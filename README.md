# HomeServer
My Home Server Project, with a bunch of selfhosted apps.
Most of them are currently running in docker containers and are managed via portainer.

#### Docker Compose Files
A Collection of docker-compose files running on my home server.
All were deployed as stacks using the portainer web UI.

None of the container ports are being forwarded to the WWW so don't even try, lol.
